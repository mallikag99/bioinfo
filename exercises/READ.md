#Prog4x.py 
##Overview
Print out the gene names for all genes whose name begins with "A" or "D" except those belonging to Homo sapiens. and whose expression level is greater than 160.

#Prog5x.py 
##Overview 
For each gene, print out a message giving the gene name and saying whether its GC content is high (greater than 0.65), low (less than 0.45) or medium (between 0.45 and 0.65)

#q1.py 
##Overview
Write a function that takes two arguments – a protein sequence and an amino acidresidue code – and returns the percentage of the protein that the amino acid makes up and checks few assertions 

#q2.py 
##Overview 
Write a function that takes two arguments – wherein it accepts a list of amino acid residues rather than a single one. If no list is given, the function should return the percentage of hydrophobic amino acid residues (A, I, L, M, F, W, Y and V) and checks few assertions
